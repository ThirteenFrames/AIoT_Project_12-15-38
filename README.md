This is an automated facial recognition system, which can be used for registration systems in schools. 

It is important that there should be a directory called "Students" present. 

In the directory, the images of the faces should be stored in order of the register. The first image should be named "img_01", the second image "img_02", and so on. Currently this directory includes the faces of our group members. 

Additionally, there should be a text file containing a list of student names, in register order. The names should be separated with a linebreak. 

Using the face_recognition library may require the use of linux. The program also uses opencv, a library used for computer vision. 

To run the program, simply run the 'Main.py' file.
